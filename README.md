<h3>In this project, I created a web application using Express.js and MongoDB for user registration, login, and searching by username or email. Users can register with fields like username, password, full name, gender, date of birth, and country. JWT tokens are used for authentication. Data validation is enforced on the server side to ensure secure and valid inputs. I demonstrated the functionality using Postman, and the complete project is uploaded to my GitHub, along with a video walkthrough showing the code, output, Postman results, and database interactions.</h3>
